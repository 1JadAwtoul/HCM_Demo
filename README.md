# Headcount Management Dashboard

### Description:
This project is a web-based dashboard that displays live headcount data for multiple teams. 
The dashboard provides an easy-to-use interface for users to submit headcount shifting requests, which can then be reviewed and approved by team managers.
The app also has a feature to send an email notification to all parties involved (in the case of this demo, my personal email is used).
The app also allows managers to update the team database with the use of simple approval button. 
Overall, the app provides an efficient and streamlined way to manage headcount data in real-time.
